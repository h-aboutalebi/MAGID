        <reason>Utterance 1 with image would help visualize the sport being discussed and provide a clear distinction from skiing, as per the conversation's context.
        utterance 5 is also descriptive sentence that can be better supported by image to provide a visual representation of the kind of farming the speaker is involved in
        utterance 0,4,6,7 are questions so no image needed. utterance 2 does not describe anything so no image needed</reason>
